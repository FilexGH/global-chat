#### Welcome!

This is a global chat web application, and my first use to firebase.

The Project is built in the following Technologies:

**Front-End:**
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* Plain CSS

**Back-End**
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

**Usage**

After downloading the project or cloning you will have to install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install 
```

You will have to add your firebase config and add a collection named on firestore `Messages`: 

* Add your firebase config on `src/firebase.js`

**You can find commands about the usage `package.json` as any normal react app created with (create-react-app).**
